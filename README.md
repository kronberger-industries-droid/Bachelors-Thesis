## Questions we want to answer

### What type of flow are we expecting?
1. rather low [[Reynolds number ( 1 )]], meaning laminar flow -> bad mixing, [[No-Slip condition]]
2. [[Knudsen number ( 1 )]] will 
### How to calculate the leak and how much impact does it have?

### Flow after inlet (Distribution)?
1. Dependend on leakage!
### Whats important for homogeneous reaction on the sample?
1. Well obvious answer: as much mixing -> as much turbulence as possible 
### Flow after inlet (Distribution)?
1. Dependend on leakage: if diff. pressure is high -> ??
2. Adams iterative solution.
3. going forward probably open_foam solvers?
### Quantification?

### Questions for later
#### Heat flow in the Nozzle? ( Ignored almost completely )
1. Is probably related with boundary layer thickness just like diffusion.
#### Velocity crucial for the Mass-spec? ( @Adam )
