Trying to find the simples version of the problem will naturally lead to the version with the most assumptions made. These assumptions will be corresponding to the flow regimes mentioned in chapter [[1.1 - Idealized Flow Regimes]].
This leads to the following areas of simplification:
1. [[1.1.1 Energy balance -> Turbulence]]: With the simples version clearly being a laminar flow 
3. [[1.1.2 - Transport mechanism]]
4.
