# Knudsen number ( 1 )

The Knudsen number is a dimensionless quantity used to characterize the degree of rarefaction of a gas or fluid flow. It is defined as the ratio of the mean free path of gas molecules to a characteristic length scale of the system or flow. It helps determine which [[Idealized Flow Regimes]] is applicable.
### Basic Formula
$$ Kn = \frac{\lambda}{L_c} $$
$\lambda\dots$[[Mean free path ( m )]]
$L \dots$[[Characteristic Length ( m )]]
