# Heterogeneous catalysis

## Mechanism

According to Surface adsorption theory heterogeneous catalysis has five stages:

**Stage 1: Diffusion of Reactant(s) to the Surface:**
The rate at which reactants will diffuse to the surface will be influenced by their bulk concentration and by the thickness of the boundary layer.

**Stage 2: Adsorption of reactants:**
Bonds are formed as the reactant(s) are adsorbed onto the surface of the catalyst. The ability for an atom or molecule to stick to the surface is known, brilliantly, as the Sticking Co-efficient. This is just the ratio or percentage of molecules that end up sticking on the surface.

**Stage 3: Reaction:**
Bonds form between the atoms and molecules on the surface

**Stage 4: Desorption of products:**
Bonds are broken as the product(s) desorb from the surface.

**Stage 5: Diffusion of Product(s) away from the Surface:**
The products are then desorbed from the surface of the catalyst.
